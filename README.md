* Run `C:\msys64\mingw64.exe` - a terminal window should pop up
* Execute `pacman -Suy`
* Execute `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject`
* Execute `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-matplotlib` https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-python-matplotlib
* To test that GTK 3 is working you can run gtk3-demo
* Clone the repository  `git clone https://github.com/RozaliaSolecka/GraphicCalculator.git` 
* Copy the main.py script to C:\msys64\home\<username>
